# Current Life/ College

I go to the University of Missouri and I am currently a part of the Delta Chi Fraternity and am looking to join a technical club on campus.  I have made a lot of new friends around campus.  My freshman year I lived in Schurz hall and I don't think it was as bad as everyone says it is.  I have changed my major two times like the normal college kid.  I have had a lot of fun just hanging out with people on campus.  I like watching football and wrestling at Mizzou.  I really enjoy the IT program that Mizzou has.    

#### Majors
- Computer Engineering
- Health Sciences
- IT (current)
